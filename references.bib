% Some guide notes:
% 1. First thing to decide is what type of entry it is. 
% 2. Database entries of different types have different fields.
% 3. The fields are divided into three classes:
%    -Required: omitting the field will produce an error message and may result
%               in a badly formatted bibliography entry. 
%    -Optional: the field's info can be omitted without causing any problems. 
%    -Ignored : the field is ignored. BibTeX ignores any field that is not 
%                required or optional, so you can include any fields you want 
%                in a bibliography entry.
%
% Also note that BibTeX ignores the case of letters in the entry type.
%
% The types of all avaialbe entries are listed below:
%   * article entry, * book entry, * booklet entry, * conference entry, 
%   * inbook entry,  * incollection entry,  * inproceedings entry, 
%   * manual entry,  * mastersthesis entry, * misc entry, * phdthesis entry, 
%   * proceedings entry, * techreport entry, * unpublished entry, 
%
